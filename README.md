This repository is part of UNC Chapel Hill's Fall 2023 English 105 course, taught by Dr. Steven Gotzler.

The process documentation was created using a **_Jupyter Labs_** notebook and can be accessed [here.](https://github.com/jerrysellers95/Regional-County-Health-Data/blob/main/County%20Health%20Data.ipynb)

# Purpose

Using a national county health dataset, this repository aims to answer the following questions:

 1. What is the relationship (or is there one?) between regions and insured/uninsured status?
  
 2. If so, how does income inequality correspond to percentages of uninsured persons?

 3. Is there an increase/decrease in preventable hospital stays in regions with high uninsured populations?

# Utilizing the Data

To answer these particular questions, this repository hosts semi-recent data 2014-2015. It may be useful for comparing pre and post COVID-19 numbers
related to national public health. The culled data is specific to Region, Uninsured/Uninsured adults, Income inequality, and Preventable hospital stays.

The chart below, created using [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) represents the numbers of uninsured adults by region.

From this data can see that the South is overrepresented. 

![Uninsured adults](https://github.com/jerrysellers95/Regional-County-Health-Data/assets/152189266/46bd6510-9df6-4fa0-99a3-96ee781f4f88)

Another chart examining the numbers of preventable hospital stays would suggest that there is a correlation between region, insured/uninsured status, and preventable hospital stays.

![Preventable Hospital Stays](https://github.com/jerrysellers95/Regional-County-Health-Data/assets/152189266/f710adf5-6362-48e5-a53c-d8e3482377c3)

While more intensive analysis would be needed to prove a correlation, we can see preliinarily from this data that people living in the Southern United States are more likely to be both uninsured and experience a preventable hospital stay.

This raises important questions about access to healthcare by region and suggests that there are significant structural factors that could be contributing to these asymmetries.
